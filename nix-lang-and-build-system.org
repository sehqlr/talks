#+TITLE: My public speaking appearances (AKA talks)

* Nix lang and build system
** Overview
*** What is nix?
    - a pure functional build system
    - domain-specific programming language
    - configuration system for operating systems
    - a different way of thinking about building, configuring, and packaging software
*** What it isn't
    - a completely original or radical idea
    - the best desktop OS
    - a good DSL
    - perfect
*** Why is it worth talking about?
** Nix Store, briefly
*** more than caching
**** content-addressability
**** reproducability
*** creates a path to artifact mapping with symlinks
** Nix Lang
*** basic description
    Haskell and JSON had a baby, but can't agree on parenting styles
*** syntax
*** semantics
*** ergonomics
*** other langs 
    ... evidence it isn't the greatest
**** guix
**** expresso
**** dhall2nix
**** {cabal,yarn,composer,...}2nix
*** The derivative file format
** Nix build system
*** segue: let's use the lang to write a complete nixexpr
*** the build system a bit more in depth
*** let's build the nixexpr!
*** looking at the drv in depth
** Conclusions
*** lang sux
*** build system rox
*** store slaps
*** maybe this tool can help you today
