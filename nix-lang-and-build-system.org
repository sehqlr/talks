#+TITLE: Nix build system

* Introduction
** Why Polyglots is so great
*** the conversations I've been in or listened to
**** talking shop
**** the outlier technologies
**** new ideas
*** I hope that I can contribute to the conversation side
** What I hope you get out of this
*** exposure to a new tool/technique
*** maybe it will useful to you today?
* Overview
** What is Nix?
**** an FP package manager
***** packages are the immutable outputs of pure functions
***** packages are stored, with their deps included, in the Nix store
***** packages and their dependencies are crypographically hashed
**** domain-specific programming language for specifing those package functions
**** a whole ecosystem, including an operating system, a devops tool, and much more
**** OPINION: a breath of fresh air for building, configuring, and packaging software
** What it isn't
**** well documented
**** a good DSL
***** We're going to get into it, promise
**** the best desktop OS
***** I suppliment my package management with AppImage and Flatpak
**** perfect (hey, fresh air has bad smells too)
** Why is it worth talking about?
**** dependencies are always included in your package, so if it works on your machine, it works on all machines
**** rollbacks are a breeze
***** story about networking woes on my laptop
* Nix Store
** more than caching
*** content-addressability
*** reproducability
** creates a path to artifact mapping with symlinks
*** works with existing UNIX paradigm and tech
* Nix Lang
** basic description
*** Haskell and JSON had a baby, but can't agree on parenting styles
** syntax
** semantics
** ergonomics
** other langs / transpilers
*** guix
*** expresso
*** dhall2nix
*** {cabal,yarn,composer,...}2nix
** The derivative file format
* Nix build system
** segue: let's use the lang to write a complete nixexpr
** the build system a bit more in depth
** let's build the nixexpr!
** looking at the drv in depth
* the ecosystem that builds on this, v briefly
* Conclusions
** lang sux
** build system rox
** store slaps
** maybe this tool can help you today
