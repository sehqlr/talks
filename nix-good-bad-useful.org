* Meetup Blurb                                                     :noexport:
  In this talk, Sam will discuss Nix, the functional package manager. He will
  focus on the store (the good), the language (the bad), and how the tool and the
  greater Nix ecosystem can be leveraged to solve problems with polyglot systems
  (the useful).

  If you cannot be there in person, this talk will be recorded and available
  online.

* Introduction
** Why I wanted to give this talk
*** I want to enthuse and vent about a useful thing I'm using and learning about
    I've been using it on and off for 3 years, and I haven't gotten bored yet
*** I want to try out a different approach to introduce Nix
    Others don't focus enough on the underlying theorhetical basis of the tech, imo
*** I want to talk to more people about it
    That's one of the best parts of Polyglots: our conversations

* So, What is Nix?
** A "new" word
   #+begin_quote
   The name Nix is derived from the Dutch word _niks_, meaning _nothing_;
   build actions do not see anything that has not been explicitly declared as
   an input.

   -- "Nix: A Safe and Policy-Free System for Software Deployment", footnote 1
   #+end_quote
** an FP package manager
*** packages are the immutable outputs of pure functions
    {{{lambda}}}
    - $s$ is a specification of a package
    - $p$ is nix package
** FP DSL for specifing those packages
   Writing code in this language is
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag highlight-red
   SPOILER ALERT
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
   the part I don't like
** an entire ecosystem
   - an operating system
   - DevOps tool(s)
   - declarative user configuration mgmt
   - and much more
** MY OPINION
   a breath of fresh air for building, configuring, and packaging software
** What it isn't
*** well documented
    The manuals are alright, but there are a lot of bad examples in the wider ecosystem
*** a good DSL
    We're going to get into it, promise
*** perfect 
    hey, fresh air has bad smells too
** Why is it worth talking about?
*** Unique approach
    Nix has a unique approach to package management, with many useful implications
**** all install, upgrade, and rollback operations are atomic
**** helps with difficult dependency management
**** share reproducible build envs in source and binary forms
**** learn another DevOps system with terrible syntax /s
*** builds upon existing Unix technologies
**** default env is close to =build-essentials= in Debian
**** 

* Nix Store, the Good  
  Motivation for learning the less good parts
** =/usr/local/bin=, =./node_modules=, ...
   This is a generalized look at other package managers

   The details here are for contrasting with Nix only
*** many different directories contain files for programs and configuration
**** In Ubuntu, the Emacs executable is installed at =/usr/bin/emacs25=
     [[file:ubuntu-emacs-package.png]]
     #+BEGIN_NOTES
     https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/amd64/emacs25/filelist
     #+END_NOTES
**** Emacs elisp packages are installed in =~/.emacs.d=
**** Emacs config files are in =$HOME= or elsewhere
*** when installing or upgrading a package, these directories' contents are changed
**** when emacs is updated, the data at

*** verifying a package requires crypographic hashing of that data as a separate step
*** dependency management is a large part of what the package manager does, and when it goes wrong, your packages are broken

** =/nix/store=
   how it compares to the others
   #+name: dependencies
   #+begin_src sh :results value file :file dependencies.png :exports both
   nix-store -q --graph $(realpath $(which curl)) | dot -Tpng
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS: dependencies
   [[file:dependencies.png]]

   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   The image for the Emacs dep graph was too big
   #+END_NOTES

*** unique directories, symlinked to expected paths
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    EXCITE! more implications, but we'll cover them in detail later
    #+END_NOTES
    all packages that are built by nix go into this directory
    with their own unique path

    I think it is similar to the hashtable data structure

**** every package has a unique directory. No updates, only additions
**** installs are done with symlinks from outside the store
     e.g. a symlink from =usr/bin= into the store

*** packages, AND THEIR DEPENEDNECIES, are cryptographically hashed
    it's how the unique paths are generated

    therefore, the verification step and the build step are one and the same
    
*** within the package's directory, it is similar to current package archives

** Derivations, the unit of composition
*** derivations: the outputs of the FP package system
**** a derivation is "a package build action" (https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#idm140737318496688)
**** derivations are a set of particular attributes

*** derivations can refer to other derivations (AKA dependencies)

**** dependency management
     a derivation uses the dep's cryptographic hash as the reference. This is
     similar to a Merkle DAG, but I've never seen this term in the docs
**** composition
     $$ g \circ f(x) $$

     Derivations are composed with their dependencies like docker image layers or photoshop layers

*** The derivative file format
    surprise!

    it's JSON
#+REVEAL: split

     #+end_example

** Further Implications
    
*** caching
    the store is a binary cache for everything already, and not just for your machine

*** installs, updates, and rollbacks are atomic (both small and discrete)
    because previous packages are still available when you build a new package,
    you can point a symlink to an old version easily.

    And because a symlink is
    completely descrete (it either points to another file or it doesn't)
    packaging actions are never in a partial state.

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    LAPTOP WIFI STORY
    - happened this month
    - changing config to make my setup behave like a nixos module
    - made a change that didn't include networkmanager
    - before, I'd move the laptop to connect to the router via Ethernet
    - but this time, I realized that I could do a rollback
    - rebooted, selected the GRUB entry that I wanted, and BAM! Wifi works
    - that was it!
    - I fixed the config, tested this time, and was able to move forward without losing wifi again

*** deduplication of depdendencies
    if two different packages depdend upon the same hash, there will only be one
    copy in the store, and two symlinks pointing to it downstream

*** concurrent dependencies for everything
    since all packages are stored concurrently, it means that many different
    versions of the same depdendency are available to many packages.

*** bad packages are isolated

**** malicious

**** poorly written 

*** reproducability
    [[https://r13y.com][Is NixOS Reproducible?]]

    This means that you can build a package, and then copy
    over the files to a different machine, and it would be the same as if that
    machine built the package.

*** content-addressability
    instead of computing a hash on something you downloaded to prove its valid,
    you can ask to download a valid package with the computed hash.

    [[https://cachix.org][Cachix - Nix binary cache hosting]] 
    
*** any program and uses files for configuration can be configured with Nix
    any file can be in the Store, and symlinks can put them wherever the
    program expects a file to be. 

    This is how =home-manager= works

* Nix Lang, the bad
** basic description

*** the common term for a program in this language is a "Nix Expression" or "nixexpr"
    In many parts of the documentation, it's referred to as the "Nix Expression Language"

    I'll be using the "nixexpr" term for the remainder of the talk

*** SARCASM: Haskell and JSON had a baby, but can't agree on parenting styles
    BTW, if there are any good arguments for anything I'm complaining about,
    talk to me

    Remember: opinions are like armpits. Everyone has one, and most of them stink
*** no specifying document that I could find
    - no formal grammar
    - no language specification

*** dynamically typed
    They use "strongly" typed in their description, but I agree with "What you
    need to know before debating type systems": "strongly" typed doesn't mean
    much of anything

*** lazy evaluated
    lazy eval is like putting stuff in an online shopping cart.

    You could have something in there for months, but until you actually pay
    for it, it won't show up at your door.

*** purely functional
    {{{lambda}}}

    no side-effects, only inputs and outputs, and outputs are completely
    dependent on inputs. Same inputs, same outputs

*** domain-specific
    nixexprs are ultimately for building packages, so the design is
    constrained on purpose.

** syntax & semantics
   AKA haskell vs Javascript/JSON
   https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-expression-language
   
   #+begin_notes
   we'll go over value types and grammatical structures in parallel
   #+end_notes
** three kinds of strings
*** "" (double quotes)
    #+begin_src nix
      version = "3.2.1";
    #+end_src

    notice also that === is used for bindings, and that delimiting semicolon
     
    #+begin_notes
    I haven't quite figured out the exact rules for the semicolon

    AND if you use it where expected in the REPL it complains
    #+end_notes
*** '' '' (indented)
    #+begin_src nix
      postInstall =
        ''
          mkdir $out/bin $out/etc
          cp foo $out/bin
          echo "Hello World" > $out/etc/foo.conf
        '';
    #+end_src

    This is favored for generating files, since the text is left-shifted but
    otherwise text alignment is preserved

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    COMPLAINT: I don't know why, but the default indentation settings for
    =nix-mode= for my install of spacemacs is horrible. May be a source of my
    bias against the language, I can't objectively say.

        config = import <nixpkgs/modules> {};

    This assumes a file called =default.nix= to be in the directory
** Booleans

** Lists
*** square brackets, no commas
    #+begin_src nix
    [ ]
    #+end_src
*** heterogenous
*** lazy in values, strict in length
    no infinite lists for you!
** Sets (the most important type!)
*** a collection of attributes wrapped in curly-braces
*** access members with =.= syntax
*** keys are either unquoted, or double-quoted
*** if key is =null= attr is dropped from set
*** if set has =__functor= it becomes callable
    Because this is Python-esque, and it sounds funny, I'm calling this a
    "dunder functor"
*** set theory operations
** functions
   NOTE: this was not included in the Values section in the docs even though
   this is an FP lang. Curious.
*** whitespace is function application
*** curried
*** partial application
*** two styles for args: lambda and set

*** github project for main repo
     
**** inclusion into nixpkgs is done via Issues and PRs
**** search and discovery are not great

     the most efficient search and discovery is from browsing the src

*** PPAs and similar can be added if narinfo file exists

*** I miss AUR sometimes

* The Nix Ecosystem
  Lets take a brief tour of the larger ecosystem built on this system

** official parts
*** NixOS
**** not the best desktop os, I suppliment my package management with AppImage and Flatpak
*** NixOps
*** Disnix
*** Hydra
** beyond
*** home-manager
*** lorri
*** cachix
*** static nix

* Conclusions
** lang sux, maybe use Dhall??
** build system rox
** store slaps
** maybe this tool can help you today

*** this covers the whole ecosystem, 1:23 duration

*** audience interaction
*** Intro to Nix
**** the big idea: FP has taught the world that global mutable state is bad, mkay?
**** problems with current state of affairs
***** in-place mutation (pkg installs) cannot be undone, hard to trace, etc...
***** dependencies (diamond inheritance problem)
***** unintended breakages
***** not composable
***** Ansible et al can drift
***** testing/QA is difficult for packaging
**** solution: "don't do that"
     This is not great! I'm really happy that I'm going to talk about the Nix
     store separately.
***** deterministic, isolated, timeless (all files are fixed at UNIX epoch)
***** no globals / immutable env
***** dependencies are only accessible via content-address
***** nix user profile
***** diamond problem
      I'd argue that the diamond problem does come up, it's a compilation error
***** nix has sandboxing all the down to the kernel
**** implications
